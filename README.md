## Overview

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Carol mostly worked on getting the app to run faster, better, and higher.  She did the best work possible but her contributions were overpowered and not well received by the fans.

### Ahmed Torki
### Alexia Leon
Alexia worked on the creation of the favorites page, and making the API fetch the quotes. She also created the login page, created the Database, and worked on the userLogin function. Alexia also helped display the translated quotes on the home page. 

### Jonathan Ramirez
### Rull Mendez


+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Managing pull requests and merges

  + We were all new to git/github and not everyone followed convention
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Finally getting the IDs from the API calls to store in the ROOM database
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would get the ROOM database setup FIRST
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Do the work early and document EVERYTHING
